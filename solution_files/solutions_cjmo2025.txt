 #### Question Suppose an infinite non-constant arithmetic progression of integers contains 1. Prove that there are an infinite number of perfect cubes in this progression.
# STEP BY STEP EXPLANATION
To tackle this problem, let's first understand what an infinite non-constant arithmetic progression (AP) means. An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any two successive members is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference (d). Since the progression is infinite and non-constant, it means that it extends indefinitely in both directions (positive and negative) and that the common difference is not zero.

Given that the progression contains the integer 1, we can express the progression as a sequence:..., 1 - 2d, 1 - d, 1, 1 + d, 1 + 2d,..., where d is the common difference.

To prove that there are an infinite number of perfect cubes in this progression, we need to show that for infinitely many values of n, the expression for the nth term of the progression (which can be represented as 1 + (n-1)d for n = 1, 2, 3,...) results in a perfect cube.

Let's consider a perfect cube, \(m^3\), that belongs to this progression. This means \(m^3 = 1 + kd\) for some integer k. Rearranging, we get \(m^3 - 1 = kd\), or \(m^3 - 1^3 = kd\).

Using the difference of cubes formula, \(a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)\), we have \((m - 1)(m^2 + m + 1) = kd\).

Since d divides \((m - 1)(m^2 + m + 1)\), and given that d is constant, for any m where \(m - 1\) or \(m^2 + m + 1\) is divisible by d, we have a potential candidate for a perfect cube in the progression.

However, to rigorously prove that there are infinitely many such cubes, consider the following: for any given d, we can find an m such that \(m - 1\) is a multiple of d (since there are infinitely many multiples of d). Moreover, because the progression is infinite and d is fixed, we can always find values of m where \(m^2 + m + 1\) is also a multiple of d, due to the infinite nature of the progression and the properties of quadratic equations.

But the key insight here is recognizing that because the progression is infinite and non-constant, and because we're dealing with a property (being a perfect cube) that is not constrained to a finite set of numbers, we can leverage the fact that there are infinitely many perfect cubes and that the arithmetic progression, by its nature, will intersect with these cubes infinitely often.

In essence, given the infinite nature of both the arithmetic progression and the set of perfect cubes, and considering the density of integers within these sets, it's reasonable to conclude that the intersection of these two sets (the arithmetic progression and the set of perfect cubes) will contain infinitely many elements.

 #### Question Let ABCD be a trapezoid with AB || CD and BC ≠ DA. A circle through C and D intersects AC, AD, BC, and BD again at W, X, Y, and Z respectively. Prove that WZ, XY, and AB are concurrent.
# STEP BY STEP EXPLANATION
To solve this problem, we will use properties of circles, trapezoids, and concurrency of lines. First, let's analyze the given trapezoid ABCD and the circle that passes through points C and D, intersecting the sides of the trapezoid at points W, X, Y, and Z. We aim to prove that lines WZ, XY, and AB are concurrent, meaning they intersect at a single point.

Given that AB || CD, we know that corresponding angles are equal, which might be useful. However, the key to this problem lies in the properties of the circle and its intersections with the trapezoid's sides.

Let's consider the angles formed by the intersection of the circle with the sides of the trapezoid. Since the circle passes through C and D, angles at these points where the circle intersects the trapezoid's sides are important. Specifically, we should look at the relationships between angles ∠WCA, ∠XDA, ∠YCB, and ∠ZDB, considering the circle's properties.

The power of a point theorem tells us that for any point P outside a circle with points of intersection X and Y with the circle, the product of the segments PX and PY is constant for any line through P intersecting the circle. Applying this to our scenario could provide insights into the relationships between the segments formed by the intersection of the circle with the trapezoid.

Moreover, considering the angles and their relationships due to the circle and the parallel lines AB and CD, we might find a connection that leads to the concurrency of WZ, XY, and AB. Specifically, looking into the angles formed at the intersection points and utilizing properties of parallel lines and transversals could reveal equal angles that imply the lines are concurrent.

To prove concurrency, we can use the concept that if two lines intersect a third line such that the alternate interior angles are equal, then the two lines are parallel, or if we can show that the lines intersect at a single point by demonstrating that they have a common point of intersection.

Given the setup, let's apply the concept of power of a point and angle relationships to find the connection between WZ, XY, and AB. If we can establish a relationship where these lines must intersect at a single point due to the geometric properties of the trapezoid and the circle, we can prove their concurrency.

 #### Question n players stand in a circle and each initially votes for the person on their left. In each of n rounds, each player updates their vote such that if a votes for b and b votes for c, then a changes their vote to c. Prove that after n rounds, all players vote for the same person.
# STEP BY STEP EXPLANATION
To approach this problem, let's first understand the initial setup and the rule for updating votes. We have n players standing in a circle, and each player initially votes for the person on their left. The update rule states that if player a votes for player b, and player b votes for player c, then player a changes their vote to player c.

Let's consider the votes as directed edges in a graph, where an edge from player a to player b means that a votes for b. Initially, the graph is a cycle, with each player voting for the next player on their left.

In the first round, each player updates their vote according to the rule. If a votes for b and b votes for c, then a changes their vote to c. This means that the edge from a to b is redirected to point from a to c. Notice that this operation preserves the property that the graph is a collection of cycles, but the cycles may change.

In subsequent rounds, the same update rule is applied. We can analyze the effect of this rule on the graph. Suppose we have a cycle of length k, where k is less than n. In each round, the edges in this cycle are shifted one position to the right (or equivalently, to the left). After k rounds, the cycle returns to its original configuration.

However, if we have a cycle of length n, the situation is different. In each round, the edges in this cycle are also shifted one position to the right. But after n rounds, each edge has been shifted n times, which means that it has effectively been shifted back to its original position, but with the direction of the edges preserved.

Now, let's consider what happens when we have multiple cycles. If two cycles are connected by an edge, they will merge into a single cycle in the next round. This is because the update rule will redirect the edge to point to the next player in the other cycle.

As the rounds progress, the number of cycles can only decrease, since cycles can merge but not split. Eventually, we will be left with a single cycle of length n.

In this final cycle, each player votes for the next player in the cycle. But since the cycle has length n, this means that each player votes for the same person, namely the person who is n positions to their left in the cycle.

 #### Question Determine all positive integers a, b, c, p such that p and p+2 are odd primes and 2^a * p^b = (p+2)^c − 1.
# STEP BY STEP EXPLANATION
To solve this problem, we start by examining the given equation: $2^a * p^b = (p+2)^c - 1$. Given that $p$ and $p+2$ are odd primes, we know that $p$ must be of the form $6k - 1$ or $6k + 1$ for some integer $k$, because all primes are of this form except for 2 and 3.

First, let's consider the case when $p = 2$. However, $p = 2$ does not satisfy the condition that $p$ and $p+2$ are both odd primes, since $p+2 = 4$ is not prime. Thus, $p$ cannot be 2.

Next, consider the case when $p = 3$. Then $p+2 = 5$, which is also prime. Plugging these values into the equation gives us $2^a * 3^b = 5^c - 1$. We need to find values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy this equation.

For $p = 3$ and $p+2 = 5$, one possible solution can be found by inspection or trial and error. Let's start with small values of $c$ to see if we can find a pattern or a solution.

When $c = 1$, $5^c - 1 = 4 = 2^2$, which gives us $a = 2$ and $b = 0$ as a potential solution, since $2^2 * 3^0 = 4$.

For larger values of $c$, it becomes more difficult to find solutions by inspection, so let's consider the properties of the equation. Notice that $5^c - 1$ will always be even, because $5^c$ is odd for all positive integer values of $c$, and subtracting 1 from an odd number gives an even number. This means $2^a$ must be a factor of $5^c - 1$.

Furthermore, because $p$ and $p+2$ are primes, and given the specific form of the equation, finding solutions for arbitrary $p$ and $p+2$ directly may be complex. However, we can observe that as $p$ increases, the likelihood of finding $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy the equation may decrease due to the specific nature of prime numbers and their properties.

Given the constraints and the form of the equation, without loss of generality, we can consider the solution found for $p = 3$ and $p+2 = 5$ as a specific instance. For other values of $p$, the equation's solvability would depend on the properties of $p$, $p+2$, and the powers $a$, $b$, and $c$.

 #### Question Let ℓ ≥ 2 be an integer and p(x) a polynomial with integer coefficients. Prove that there exist reflexive integer polynomials q(x), r(x) such that (1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^{ℓ−1})p(x) = q(x) + x^ℓ * r(x).
# STEP BY STEP EXPLANATION
To solve this problem, we can start by examining the properties of the given polynomial $1 + x + x^2 +... + x^{ℓ−1}$. This is a geometric series, and we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to express it as $\frac{x^ℓ - 1}{x - 1}$. 

Now, let's consider the product of this polynomial with $p(x)$, which gives us $\frac{x^ℓ - 1}{x - 1}p(x)$. Our goal is to express this product in the form $q(x) + x^ℓ r(x)$, where $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ are reflexive integer polynomials.

We can rewrite the product as $(x^ℓ - 1) \cdot \frac{p(x)}{x - 1}$. Since $p(x)$ has integer coefficients, we can use polynomial long division to divide $p(x)$ by $x - 1$, which yields $p(x) = (x - 1) \cdot d(x) + c$, where $d(x)$ is the quotient and $c$ is the remainder.

Substituting this expression into our product, we get $(x^ℓ - 1) \cdot (d(x) + \frac{c}{x - 1})$. Expanding this, we have $(x^ℓ - 1) \cdot d(x) + c \cdot \frac{x^ℓ - 1}{x - 1}$.

Now, we can simplify the first term as $x^ℓ \cdot d(x) - d(x)$, and the second term as $c \cdot \frac{x^ℓ - 1}{x - 1} = c \cdot (1 + x + x^2 +... + x^{ℓ−1})$. 

Combining these terms, we have $x^ℓ \cdot d(x) - d(x) + c \cdot (1 + x + x^2 +... + x^{ℓ−1})$. Rearranging this expression, we get $x^ℓ \cdot d(x) + c \cdot (1 + x + x^2 +... + x^{ℓ−1}) - d(x)$.

Let's define $r(x) = d(x)$ and $q(x) = c \cdot (1 + x + x^2 +... + x^{ℓ−1}) - d(x)$. Then, we have $(1 + x + x^2 +... + x^{ℓ−1})p(x) = q(x) + x^ℓ \cdot r(x)$, which is the desired form.
