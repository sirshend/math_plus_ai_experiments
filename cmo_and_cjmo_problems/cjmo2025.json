    "question": "Suppose an infinite non-constant arithmetic progression of integers contains 1. Prove that there are an infinite number of perfect cubes in this progression.",
    "solution": "Let a and d be the first term and common difference. Consider numbers of the form (1 + kd)^3. These expand to 1 + d × integer. Hence, infinitely many perfect cubes lie in the arithmetic progression."

    "question": "Let ABCD be a trapezoid with AB || CD and BC ≠ DA. A circle through C and D intersects AC, AD, BC, and BD again at W, X, Y, and Z respectively. Prove that WZ, XY, and AB are concurrent.",
    "solution": "Using cyclic quadrilateral properties and radical axis theorem: AB, WZ, and XY are all radical axes of pairs of circles and must concur by the three-circle radical axis concurrency theorem."

    "question": "n players stand in a circle and each initially votes for the person on their left. In each of n rounds, each player updates their vote such that if a votes for b and b votes for c, then a changes their vote to c. Prove that after n rounds, all players vote for the same person.",
    "solution": "Using graph-based reasoning and cycle reduction, it’s shown that within ⌊log2 n⌋ rounds the voting graph reduces to a self-loop and the rest converge within ⌈log2 n⌉ rounds. Total ≤ n rounds always suffices."

    "question": "Determine all positive integers a, b, c, p such that p and p+2 are odd primes and 2^a * p^b = (p+2)^c − 1.",
    "solution": "The only solution is (a, b, c, p) = (3, 1, 2, 3). This reduces to solving 2^a * 3^b = 25 − 1 = 24, giving a = 3 and b = 1."

    "question": "Let ℓ ≥ 2 be an integer and p(x) a polynomial with integer coefficients. Prove that there exist reflexive integer polynomials q(x), r(x) such that (1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^{ℓ−1})p(x) = q(x) + x^ℓ * r(x).",
    "solution": "Two solutions: (1) Construct q(x) and r(x) using algebraic symmetry (involves evaluating p(1/x)). (2) Use matrices and linear algebra to build reflexive polynomials by decomposing matrix representations with horizontal symmetry."
