    "question": "n players stand in a circle and each initially votes for the person on their left. In each of n rounds, each player updates their vote such that if a votes for b and b votes for c, then a changes their vote to c. Prove that after n rounds, all players vote for the same person.",
    "solution": "We prove that after ⌊log2 n⌋ rounds the voting graph becomes a self-loop and then all players' votes converge to this loop within another ⌈log2 n⌉ rounds. Detailed argument involves cycle reduction and path halving logic. Thus, within n rounds, all players vote for the same person."

    "question": "Determine all positive integers a, b, c, p where p and p + 2 are odd primes and 2^a * p^b = (p + 2)^c − 1.",
    "solution": "The only solution is (a, b, c, p) = (3, 1, 2, 3). The right side is factored, and constraints on p and p+2 being twin primes are used. Eventually we reduce to 2^a * 3^b = 5^2 − 1 = 24, implying a = 3, b = 1, c = 2, p = 3."

    "question": "Let ℓ ≥ 2 be an integer and p(x) a polynomial with integer coefficients. Prove that there exist reflexive polynomials q(x), r(x) such that (1 + x + ... + x^{ℓ−1})p(x) = q(x) + x^ℓ * r(x).",
    "solution": "Two solutions are provided. One is constructive using polynomial identities and reflexive definitions (p(x) = x^n * p(1/x)). The second uses matrix representation and shows how q and r can be built from trapezoidal and symmetric matrix structures."

    "question": "In triangle ABC with circumcircle Γ and AB ≠ AC, points D and E lie on arc BC not containing A such that ∠BAE = ∠DAC. Let X, Y be incenters of triangles BAE and CAD. External tangents of their incircles intersect at Z. Prove Z lies on the common chord of Γ and the circumcircle of triangle AXY.",
    "solution": "Using spiral similarity and incenter angle properties, we prove that Z lies on the external angle bisector of ∠XAY, which also contains the intersection point N of circles (ABC) and (AXY), so A, Z, N are collinear."

    "question": "A rectangle R is divided into smaller rectangles such that no three share a corner. An ant starts at the bottom-left corner and can move to adjacent corners of selected rectangles. Show that if the ant reaches the top-right corner, then some rectangle was used in at least two moves.",
    "solution": "Multiple proofs are provided. One uses arc-based connectivity to show that without repeated rectangles, no corner-to-corner path exists. Another uses move invariants (like direction and side used). A third argument proves that the motion must eventually violate the non-overlap condition unless a rectangle is reused."
